## The following parameters are available to set up the device. They can either be set as an epics environmental variable, or passed as a macro to the 'runScript' command:

# The following macros are available to set up the mrfioc2:
# SYS 			 is used as a prefix for all records.
# DEVICE		 is the event generator / timing card name. (default: EVG0)
# EVG_SLOT		 is the VME crate slot where the card is inserted. (default: 2)
# EVG_MEMOFFSET	 is the base A24 address (default: 0x0)
# EVG_IRQLINE 	 is the interrupt level. (default: 0x2)
# EVG_IRQVECT 	 is the interrupt vector (default: 0x1)
# EVG_SUBS       is the path to the substitution file that should be loaded. (default: cfg/$(DEVICE).subs=cfg/EVG0.subs)
#                The following macros can be used to load example substitution files already available in the mrfioc2 module:
#                EVG_SUBS=$(mrfioc2_DB)/evg_VME-300.subs      for EVM-VME-300 device series
#                EVG_SUBS=$(mrfioc2_DB)/evg_VME-300-fout.subs for EVM-VME-300 operating as a fanout
#                EVG_SUBS=$(mrfioc2_DB)/evg_VME-230.subs      for EVG-VME-230 device series

runScript $(mrfioc2_DIR)/mrfioc2_evg-VME.cmd, "SYS=MTEST-VME-TIMINGTEST, DEVICE=EVG0, EVG_SLOT=2, EVG_MEMOFFSET=0x000000, EVG_IRQLINE=0x2"
