EXAMPLE STARTUP SCRIPT AND EXAMPLE SUBSTITUTION FILES
======================

`mrfioc2/PSI/example` folder contains example startup scripts. They load default substitution files which are available in `mrfioc2/PSI/example/cfg` folder (*.subs files). Each substitution file coresponds to a specific form factor/firmware version and contains all the available macros the user needs to start using the driver. More details are available in the documentation.


COMPILATION
===========

To complile to a PSI style module (loadable with require) run `make` in the parent folder.

Compilation will only work on a PSI infrastructure where the correct applications and environment variables are already configured.


DATABASES
=========

To expand the databases you need `msi` tool installed (available as an EPICS extension). Then run `make db` in the parent folder. You cannot install the module before databases are expanded.

There is also an option to manually expand the databases using the provided script, but the above mentioned method should be used whenever possible:

cd mrfioc2/PSI
./make_databases.sh

The script should be executed in the PSI folder otherwise you need to specify the top folder of mrfioc2 with the -t switch:

cd /tmp
<top_mrfioc2_folder>/PSI/make_databases.sh -t <top_mrfioc2_folder>

Databases are automatically expanded in the ./db folder but you can also change the output folder with the -o switch:

cd mrfioc2/PSI
./make_databases.sh -o /home/johndoe/workspace/PSI/databases


DOCUMENTATION
=============

A tutorial and general EVR manual is available in the `mrfioc2/documentation` folder. The tutorials are tailored for PSI users, where EVR manual is intended for general audience.

Original mrfioc2 documentation is located in the documentation folder and be expanded into HTML using Doxygen:

cd mrfioc2
Doxygen

A folder named html is created in the documentation folder. Open the index.html file in that folder. The first page contains the changelog as well as links to other pages.
